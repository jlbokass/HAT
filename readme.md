# Welcome to HAT project

This is a simple MVC framework for building my blog in PHP. I did this work thanks to Dave
Hollingworth's tutorials and the advice of my mentor Gauthier Burgeat.

This work is done as part of my PHP web developer training with Openclassroom - project 5.

**Attention, this blog is my reflection: I used the knowledge of different courses that I learned and put them
into practice. In no way the errors that could be found are the fact of the people cited.**

## Installation

1. First, download the framework, either directly or by cloning the repo.
1. Rename the .en.dist => .env and uncomment the line with your DB   
1. Run **composer update** to install the project dependencies.
1. Configure your web server to have the **public** folder as the web root.

next coming soon.
